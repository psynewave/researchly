Research.ly
=====================

A hackathon project built demonstrating a mashup between Retsly tax data and MLSListing BI data.

### Run Dev Server

npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000

### Linting

Uses React-friendly ESLint configuration

npm run lint

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.
